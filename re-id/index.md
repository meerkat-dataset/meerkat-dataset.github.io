This is the repository for the **Meerkat Re-identification Dataset** used in the paper **Recurrence over Video Frames (RoVF) for the Re-identification of Meerkats** presented as a poster at the CVPR 2024 Workshop CV4Animals, and the paper **Recurrence over Video Frames (RoVF) for Animal Re-identification** under consideration for publication.<br/>

## Dataset
This dataset repurposes the [Meerkat Behaviour Recognition Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11326) for video-based meerkat re-identification using clips extracted from the annotated tracks. No IDs are provided for individuals, but by using co-occurrences of individuals, we use this dataset to match individuals.

We are looking for options to host the dataset, for now we will use DropBox due to the folder size. If there are problems accessing this dataset please contact Mitchell Rogers ([mrog173@aucklanduni.ac.nz](mailto:mrog173@aucklanduni.ac.nz)).
